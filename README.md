An application for users to track the birds they have seen while out birding.


The users will be able to create uniques accounts with passwords encrypted with bcrypt. Then will be able to create watchlists of birds they have seen at vaious locations. These lists can be deleted or modified, so they create a basic crud model. 

When a watchlist is created, it will find or create models for the location and birds that it is associated with. it will allow the user and other users to see activity at certain areas, and to see what birds are common or prevalent.
